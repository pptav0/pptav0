# 👋 Hi, I’m Jose (pptav0)

I’m a Data Scientist with an applied math mindset, transitioning from engineering into data-driven roles. I build reproducible ML workflows and performance-oriented engineering tools — especially where **markets, time-series, and real-time systems** meet.

---

## 🔭 What I’m building
- **Quant & market microstructure tooling**: streaming market data → time-series → indicators → analytics → storage  
- **Forecasting & decision analytics**: classical + ML + foundation models, with leakage-safe evaluation  
- **Engineering apps**: low-latency Rust systems, clean Python pipelines, and scientific computing in Julia

---

## 🧠 Focus areas
- Time-series forecasting (CV, backtesting mindset, stress testing)
- Feature engineering for noisy, real-world signals
- Model interpretability (SHAP, diagnostics, error analysis)
- Data quality + governance for ML systems (especially in regulated / industrial contexts)
- High-performance computing and memory-safe design (Rust)

---

## 🧰 Tech I use
- **Rust**: systems, low-latency pipelines, concurrency, tooling
- **Python**: ML/DS (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow), notebooks → packages
- **Julia**: simulation, scientific computing, differential equations
- Storage & infra: Docker, SQL/NoSQL, event-driven architectures (when relevant)

---

## 📌 Selected project themes
- **Algo-trading & analytics**: indicators, footprints, order-flow features, research tooling  
- **Energy / industrial DS**: predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, operations analytics  
- **LLM workflows (private data)**: RAG pipelines, evaluation, and reliability-minded deployment

---

## 🤝 Open to collaborate on
- Quant research & time-series forecasting projects  
- Rust-based data/analytics tooling  
- ML evaluation pipelines (CV, leakage prevention, reproducibility)

## 📫 Reach me
- GitHub Discussions / Collaboration

> Motto: build it **correct**, then build it **fast**.
